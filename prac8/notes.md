- Prolog is the most intuitive language I've used as part of this unit
- Condition chaining via 'and' (',') allows for a very logical order of operations
    - Or statements via 'or' (';') creates extremely intuitive 'if'/'case' statement equivalents
- Prolog splits almost everything into function-equivalents
    - Feels very similar to my regular programming style in languages like python
    - Allows for very easy abstraction
- Also one of the least verbose languages I've seen
- Seems like it might not be very scaleable

## Specific Question:
- I found fizzbuzz much easier to implement in prolog than in other language
- Maybe the fizzbuzz problem just suits a language like prolog well?
- Each condition in fizzbuzz (fizz, buzz etc) can so easily be split into a condition/rule
- While I found fizzbuzz easily to implement in a straightforward and 'neat' way, I feel like my solution is not very scaleable - exit condition needs to be hardcoded
    - Iteration might be my least favourite component - while it's still intuitive, I dislike the fact that it was hardcoded
