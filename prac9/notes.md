- Got stuck on CDR/CAR syntax being backwards for the longest time (sort of makes sense but example of the kind of thing I found extremely counterintuitive)
- The bracket syntax is a nightmare to read
  - There were so many times I got extremely unintuitive errors (such as accessing 2 variables never being equal) because of wonky brackets
- The entire time I felt like everything I was doing was terrible for performance (calling the same function multiple times etc)
- It's just so different from traditional programming languages that all the instincts you've built up over the years are fighting you
