## Reflection
- The syntax is kind of confusing and seems contrarian
- The logic of having all functionality passed to objects (which are everything) was actually very intuitive to me
- `<value> <statement>` makes sense to me and seems consistently implemeneted (i.e. even in if statements)
- All focus is placed on 'variables' or elements and then giving/retrieving properties
    - Makes syntax highly consistent even when it's different
- Iteration syntax follows the same logic but I found it a little counterintuitive
    - I initially had trouble understanding the reasoning behind the loop syntax (passing it a function to be run at each iteration)

## Assignment Question - Compare smalltalk to fortran/algol fizzbuzz implementation
- Smalltalk's syntax is very different to fortran or algol 
    - Compared to fortran-ada difference, this is much stronger - fundamental syntax structure is different 
- Though smalltalk's syntax is different, it actually makes more sense to me and I think would make more sense to beginners especially
  - Strong consistency
  - High orthogonality - every piece of syntax/operator has one function with very little overlap (at least in this function)
    - Much more syntax to remember in fortran and algol (especially fortran)
      - Much less boilerplate code
